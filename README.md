#OSAGEIAMOS - Oh S***! A Game Engine In A Month Or So
## Who?
'Tis I, Johnathon Kemp
## What?
As the title, a game engine in a month or so. Done as part of a group project for my course at univeristy to make a game in Java
## Where?
Now that's telling
## When?
From 13/01/2020 - 27/03/2020 (yes, that's more than a month. Buuuuuut, I did say a month **or so**, so I'm technically not wrong :P)
## Why?
To help with the understanding of how certain mechanics of a game engine work together to be able to implement a game, so that I look moderately smart when I implement it in the group version and it works first time ;)
## How?
Frankly, I'm not too sure. I've never made a game engine before and I'm well aware it ain't too easy. I'm currently praying to the gods for some help, sacrificed 7 virgins to appease them, and currently harnessing my awesome searching and Stack Overflow skills to be able to figure the rest out. Hopefully it works out, either way this repo will be full of hot, smelly garbage, or still garbage but it's cold garbage \_0_/
